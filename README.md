# Market-Segmentation-analysis-for-Mall-customers
A machine learning project leveraging Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for customer segmentation using K-means and Hierarchical Clustering for targeted marketing strategies.

#Project Overview:

This project aims to segment customers of a mall based on their purchasing behavior. By understanding customer segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

#Data:

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about customers, including their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

#Methodology:

#Data Exploration:

#Load and clean the data.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships between variables.
Visualize the data using Matplotlib to gain insights.

#Model Building:

#K-Means Clustering:
  Implement the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers based on their features.
  Use the Elbow Method (WCSS) to determine the optimal number of clusters.

#Hierarchical Clustering:
  Apply Hierarchical Clustering to create a dendrogram and identify optimal clusters.

#Model Evaluation:

#Visualize the clusters using scatter plots.
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into customer segments.
Libraries Used:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical operations.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine Learning algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering).

#Key Concepts:

WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares): A measure of how closely data points are clustered together. Lower WCSS indicates tighter clusters.
Dendrogram: A tree-like diagram that illustrates the hierarchical clustering process. It helps visualize the merging of clusters at different levels.
Future Work:

#Future Works

Explore other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN.
Incorporate additional features like customer preferences and purchase history.
Develop a web application to visualize the segmentation results.
To run the code:

#Clone this repository.

Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Python script.
Note: Ensure you have the necessary data file in the same directory as the script.
